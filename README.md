# 📊 Time Series Analysis with Python

This repository is a complete walkthrough of **Time Series Analysis**, covering the end-to-end process of analyzing temporal data. From initial visualization and decomposition to testing for stationarity and implementing ARIMA models for forecasting, this project offers a structured, hands-on guide to time series techniques using Python.

If you're interested in financial modeling, climate data trends, energy demand forecasting, or sales prediction — the methods covered here form the foundation of any serious time series forecasting workflow.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Time series data is ubiquitous — found in everything from stock market trends and weather patterns to electricity consumption and website traffic. Unlike standard datasets, time series data is ordered and often contains seasonal and trend components.

In this project, we demonstrate:
- How to explore and visualize time-dependent data
- How to determine if a time series is **stationary**
- Techniques to make a time series stationary
- Building and validating forecasting models using the **ARIMA** approach

## 📁 Notebooks Breakdown

### 📘 1. `Time_series_analysis.ipynb`

This notebook provides the foundation:
- Time series data loading and formatting
- Line plots and initial insights
- Decomposition of time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Rolling mean and variance for stability checks
- ACF and PACF plots for correlation analysis

> 📈 *Goal:* Understand patterns and dependencies in your time series.

### 📘 2. `Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_.ipynb`

Stationarity is a crucial assumption in time series modeling. This notebook explains:
- What stationarity means and why it matters
- Applying the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test using `statsmodels`
- Interpreting ADF test outputs: test statistic, p-value, lags, etc.
- Applying differencing (first or second order) to transform non-stationary series into stationary ones

> 🧪 *Goal:* Test and prepare your data for model building.

---

### 📘 3. `ARIMA_Model.ipynb`

This notebook is the core of forecasting:
- Using ACF and PACF to estimate AR (p), I (d), MA (q) terms
- Manual vs automated model selection (using `pmdarima`)
- Fitting ARIMA models using `statsmodels`
- Forecasting future values with confidence intervals
- Visual diagnostics: residuals, Q-Q plots, prediction error

> 🔮 *Goal:* Predict future values from historical patterns using ARIMA.
